# üéµ Spotify Wrapped SQL Analysis  

This project replicates the **Spotify Wrapped experience** by analyzing personal streaming history data using **SQL**. The analysis uncovers top songs, artists, albums, listening trends, and patterns for the year **2023**.

---

## üìã Project Overview  

I requested my **Spotify Extended Streaming History**, which contained listening data spanning from **July 2022 to February 2024**. However, for this analysis, I focused solely on the data for **January 1, 2023, to December 31, 2023**, to evaluate my music habits over one full year.  

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Data Preparation  

### üîç Missing Data  
Upon thorough inspection, I noticed **388 missing rows** in the dataset. After researching, I found that:  

- Missing information can occur due to **technical glitches** during Spotify's data collection.  
- Known issues can cause incomplete records, such as missing identifiers or delayed updates.  

Since the missing values were consistent across all relevant columns, I decided to **remove those rows**, ensuring they **did not impact the accuracy** of my analysis.  

### üîß Data Cleaning  
Before importing the data into **SQL Server**, I:  
- **Removed unnecessary columns** that were not relevant for my analysis.  
- Focused on the required fields:  
  - `timestamp`  
  - `track_name`  
  - `artist_name`  
  - `album_name`  
  - `play_duration`
    
**Note:** The `play_duration` field in the dataset is recorded in **milliseconds**. To calculate the duration in **minutes**, I divided the `play_duration` by **60000** (1 minute = 60,000 milliseconds) in all relevant queries.

---

## üìä Analysis and Insights  

This project uses SQL queries to answer the following questions:  

1. **How much time did you spend listening to music in 2023?**
```sql
SELECT SUM(play_duration)/60000 AS total_duration_in_mins 
FROM #temp_streaming_history;
```
| Total Duration (in mins) | 
|--------------------------|
| 18,521                   | 

---

3. **Who were your top 5 most listened-to artists?**
  **by number of plays**
```sql
SELECT TOP 5 artist_name, COUNT(*) AS number_of_times_you_listened_to_this_artist  
FROM #temp_streaming_history
GROUP BY artist_name
ORDER BY 2 DESC;
```
| Artist Name     | Number of Times You Listened to This Artist |
|------------------|--------------------------------------------|

## üíª SQL Queries  

All SQL queries are included in the **`spotify_wrapped_analysis.sql`** file.  

**Key Highlights**:
